TASK: Create a 2D game using the software library Pygame. Game must communicate to a server
that sends the client acceleramator data of a user's cellphone.

Accomplishment: created a lite-Pokemon game using Pygame. Based on acceleramtor data, the player
gets a certain amount of virtual coins. The player can then spend those coins on Pokemon battles or a slot machine.
In order to have a Pokemon battle, the player has to pay a fee using the virtual coins. The user can also use their coins
to obtain new Pokemon via the slot machine. Using the slot machine will give the player a new random Pokemon. 

My tasks: I did all of the coding for this project. This includes adding the sprites and sound files, and coding
the main menu, battle logic, and slot machine.

The code can be found in 000Code.
