You start the game by launching the DOJ#3Game.py module.
CONTROLS:
	During dialogue press the a key to continue.
	use the 'w','a','s','d' to manuever through options
	When you get a Pokemon from the lotto, press 'enter' to continue
	Other controls will be told to you during the game.
COINS:
Coins are earned for doing activity in the real world.
Activity is based from the companion app given to us for the class.
Sign into the game using an ID that is connected to the companion app
Coins are earned after every 24 hours and when you start the game.
After initally starting the game, it will take 24 hours before you earn coins.
Coins can be used for battling or Capturing a random Pokemon. More Info about the game can be seen
in the Info option in the main menu.
SAVE FILE:
Once you first started the game, a "save file" is created in the same
folder as the game.
For grading purposes you can alter the data in this text file.
The name of the textfile is the ID you entered plus '.txt'

The order of data in the save file is as follows:
total number of battles
captured pokemon
shiny captured Pokemon
total number of games completed
total number of coins
Pokemon in team
Date and Time since the last time the Player has earned coins

Be very careful changing these values. Make sure they are in the same format,
otherwise the game will wipe the save and make a new one.
DO NOT:
change total number of battles to more than 12
do not enter a number that is less than 1 or greater than 151 in any of the Pokemon lists.
I recommend only changing the number of coins, total number of games completed and/or changing the day in the date by one day back
to see how coin earnage is shown to the player.
