TASK: Create a 3D educational game in Unity

Accomplishments: Created a turned-based battle game. The player is able to choose to fight 4
bosses in any order they want. The bosses are important molecules from chemistry such as H2O and NaCl.
PLayer defeats each boss using knowledge of the properties of each molecule. For example, the attack "break single
bonds" is an effective attack on the H2O monster because H2O molecules have single bonds.

My tasks: I did the majority of the scripting for the battle logic and main menu. Based on the boss the player
is fighting, I had to script which attacks were effective on each boss and when each animation should play.

Code can be found in the scripts folder within the assets folder.
