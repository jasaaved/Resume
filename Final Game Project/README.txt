Task: Create a game within two quarters (20 weeks)

Accomplishment: Created a three player 2D brawler game. A player can choose between a wizard, warrior, or rogue (yes, it's that generic). Each character
has three unqiue abilities. The Rogue has a three ninja star attack, a dash ability, and a rope the attaches fellow players or certain enemies. The wizard
can teleport, shoot fireballs, and cast lightning that can hurt enemies or revive dead players. The warrior has a sword slash and shield to protect herself and/or
be thrown to fellow players to protect them temporarily. The game consists of only one level but it has a mini-boss, a boss, and several enemies in between.

My task: Programmer with some input in game design. I programmed the playable characters, xbox controller support, and the backbone to how the abilities worked.
I also programmed the game manager and room managers that kept track of the players' progress and conditions. Programmed some enemy and room behaviors.
Helped design-wise to add third support ability to the characters to promote cooperation in the game. Also spent a large amount of time fixing and finding
the numerous amount of bugs created during this project.

Although this is my biggest game I have worked on, it is not the game I am most proud of. I have many issues with the game design-wise and art-wise which
is something I can go more in-depth in an interview. We should have finished the mechanics in the first 10 weeks of the project (the second 10 weeks was for polishing), 
but instead we kept iterating on the games mechanics until the very end. In the end, we ended up with a game that can provide some fun moments (using the support abilites 
and the final boss), but requires a severe amount  of polish. Although I am not completely satisfied with this project, I am grateful for the experience I have acquired 
working on this project.

The game is executable! The executable is found under the "CorruptedGame.zip". And no that game is not corrupted. Corrupted is the name of the game.
 Three Xbox controllers are required!
