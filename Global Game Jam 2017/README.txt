Task: Create a game within 48 hours at the 2017 Global Game Jam with the theme "waves"

Accomplishment: Created a twin-stick shooter. The player plays an elephant that has "wave" abilities. The elephant can use light waves to confuse enemies, water waves to
slow down enemies, and air waves to push enemies. The player must use these abilties to avoid being captured by hunters. The elephant must kill the hunters by using
its air waves to push hunters into spiky objects.

My task: lead design and programmer. It was my idea to create an isometric twin-stick shooter and I helped design the abilites the elephant had. I programmed the controls for the
elephant, added Xbox controller support, and helped program some of the abilities the elephant had.

I wish we had more time fixing some game design issues and. For example, during playtesting the air waves was the most used ability because it was the only way to kill the 
hunters so the other abilities were rarely used. How the player could die could have been reworked. Currently the player can only die if the elephant touches a spiky object
or 4 hunters attach to the elephant which is a problem because near the end of an enemy wave there may be less than 4 hunters. Despite the issues I have with this
game, I am proud of what my team and I created within 48 hours.

This game is executable and playable! The executable is in the "GameBuilds" folder. Xbox controller required!
